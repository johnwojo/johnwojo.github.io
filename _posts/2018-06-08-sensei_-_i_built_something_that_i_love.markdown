When I started programming, a seasoned engineer taught me something profound. 

"When you create a new program, you are creating a universe." 

He told me that programming is artistic. We are engaging in the act of creation. We suddenly become gardeners in a new world (that others may or may not ever even experience.) When I open that first file, it feels like a breath of fresh air. Something new is afoot. 

Over the last few weeks, I've been working to complete a project for my programming bootcamp. Now that the assignment is finished, I realized something... I really love this little universe that I made! 

In fact, even though the assignment is complete, I feel like I've only really started working on it. 

Sensei is a web app designed in Rails. I created it to solve a problem. I regularly forget important things that I've learned. I will hear a podcast, read a book, see a movie.. and feel a sense of wonder. I will learn something deep and profound, something I would like to keep with me forever. I typically underline the sentence or pause Netflix (much to my wife's dismay) and try to think about what I just saw/heard/read. I love learning. 

But the problem is that, in a year, I will have forgotten that moment. I won't remember what I read in a book two years ago or how that one podcast/speech/sermon deeply changed how I view X. And if I can't remember what I learned, how could I ever act on it? 

So I created Sensei to remind me of my own lessons... to keep them before my eyes. I don't want to forget what I've learned and Sensei is going to help me keep track of all the information and passion and wisdom that I want to assimilate. Repetition is key to that, so I built in a feature called the 'Daily Reading.' That part of the app randomizes your list of lessons, and feeds one back to you, so you can review it.

All of this reminded me of a Steve Jobs quote. 

> "Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again." Steve Jobs

It's so amazing that we get to be a part of creating Universes. How profound it is to be able to create things we love and will use - things that can change the world and the billions of people who inhabit it. 

I love my Sensei. And the biggest lesson I've learned from it is that I have only just started learning.
