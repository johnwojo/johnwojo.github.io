Throughout my early years in college, I wanted to be a little bit of everything. I started in music, but switched to engineering. I spent a semester in social work, dabbled in accounting, failed at Arabic, and almost graduated as an English education major. In the end, I obtained a degree in liberal studies. A jack of all trades, one might say. 

So why now do I choose to *specialize* in programming? 

It has taken me thirty years, but I 've noticed a pattern. 

Since as far back as I can remember, I have been especially inspired by two things: imagination and innovation. Dreaming and doing. Wonder and work. Awe and action. Believing and becoming. Creativity and craftmanship. (Okay, you get the point. Alliteration is fun, but back to the story...) 

There is something very special about dreaming up an idea - and then making it real.

These two concepts (imagination and innovation) embody the reasoning behind my transition into software development. I would never have guessed it in years past, but now I know... Programming is about telling stories, building worlds, and altering one small portion of reality at a time. It's about taking what is real and true and painting it with new possibilties. Coding is about creating - it's about designing - it's about envisioning a new set of rules for reality and then stitching your story into the real world. You can upload your visions into the universe and make it better, happier, fairer, and more beautiful. 

I have chosen coding because it is situated at the crossroads of these two very important concepts: imagining a better world and creating it. For better AND worse, computers, software, and the ever-expanding internet have arrived. And it is in this very special time in history that we have sudden access to limitless opportunity - and responsibility - to build better systems for all of those fields which I considered years ago. Simply put, with programming we can impact music, engineering, social work, accounting, communication, education, and any other horizon of our choosing. 

It's easy to answer, "Why programming?" The real question is, "Who wouldn't want to be a programmer?!"
