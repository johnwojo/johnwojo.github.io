Hey there. 

Having a rough day? 

It's okay. We've all been there. 

**You've come to the right place.**


If you're a programmer (and anything like me), you have probably (from time to time) felt the urge to absolutely crush your computer. Maybe you've been dealing with an error that just won't go away. Or your coding partner has just completely overwritten everything you did in your most recent GIT commit. Maybe your coworking space has the heat turned up so insanely high and you don't have any more layers to shed. 

Whatever the reasoning behind your current burst of flame hair (see GIF below), please know that you are not alone. All programmers (or at least the ones I've talked to) have this moment. Even if you're not an easily-angered person, you're bound to hit obstacles that make you want to pull out your hair. If you haven't gotten there yet, just wait. Your time will probably be here soon.

I'd like to offer a few potential solutions. If you have more ideas, make sure to tweet them to me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/wojo_nyc) and I'll add your suggestions to the bottom of this post! 


So, when you're struggling and want to break the screen into a million pieces with a sledgehammer: 


# DOs 


**1. Breathe.**

Okay, this one is easy. Take several (5-10) deep breaths. I'm no expert on this, but I've really benefitted from learning to breathe more deeply. Your body is probably all tensed up from thinking about all the ways you might be able to destroy your laptop. So... give yourself a second. Rome wasn't built in a day. Neither were any of the great apps we use every day. Good things take time. Stop working and spend a little time breathing.   

If you need help, here's a short helpful breathing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEfs5TJZ6Nk).



**2. Go on a walk.**

This one is similar to number one. Go walk. Take a break. Don't walk fast. Stroll. You don't need to go anywhere specific. Allow yourself to think about your surroundings. Don't pace. Just walk.

If you live in a walkable city like me (NYC), then go five or six blocks in any direction. Notice things. Remember that life doesn't consist entirely of the glowing rectangles we spend most of our days looking at. The universe exists. Touch physical things. Smell smells. Spend time intentionally noticing colors and textures. Believe it or not, this helps me a lot. It's okay to not be productive for a minute. Embracing that will help you rest and, surprisingly, will also make you a more productive person.  



**3. Talk to a friend or coworker.**

There should be no lone rangers in coding. In an increasingly connected world, it's somehow easier than ever to be completely surrounded by people and interactions and yet totally alone. Resist this. Go talk to someone. Either talk to a coroworker about the problem you're dealing with or just be a regular old human and go talk about something not code related. Don't forget.. the physical universe exists outside of your computer - and there are lots of interesting people all around you. 



**4. Look for help online.**

If you're a programmer and you haven't learned to Google yet, it's time. Google is your friend. Jump onto Twitter, join a slack or discord channel... go to StackOverflow, LinkedIn, a coding Facebook group.. look for the answers. They're out there.  Let others help. 


**5. Learn something new. **

I like this one. Sometimes the best thing you can do when learning JavaScript is to NOT learn JavaScript. Go learn how to speak Spanish. Watch a tutorial video on how to make Pixel Art. Read a chapter from a biography. Learn things that aren't coding for a little bit, so that when you return to it, ideas are fresh and your mind is fertile.


**6. Describe the problem.**

Okay, this one seems odd... but it works. I keep a little Ninja Turtle in my computer bag. When I need to better understand a problem, I vocalize it to him. Or imagine doing so (if I'm in a public place - because taking to a plastic Ninja Turtle gets you weird looks.) I've heard some developers say that they keep a rubber duck (or something like it) at their desk for just this occassion. 

Programming languages are not the only way to abstract away a concept... you can also use whatever language you speak. Vocalizing the idea helps you summarize what you're trying to do.  Writing a blog post accomplishes much of the same.


**7. Sleep on it.**

Stop, drop, and snooze. If it's an appropriate time and place to sleep, grab some zzz's. I cannot tell you the number of times I have dreamt an answer or woke up with it in my mind.


**8. Read.**


I love to read. It brings an escape for me that few other things can. Go fly off into another world. Or read something about how computers work. I wouldn't suggest scrolling on social media (more about that later), but go crack open a book, graphic novel, or medium post. Read. Again, it brings the mind back to the non-digital.


**9. Remember why you're coding.**

You will work better when you remember why you're doing what you're doing. Are you trying to solve an important problem? Are you trying to grow yourself? Provide for your family? Get humans to Mars before we destroy Earth and all her inhabitants? Go back to this. Remember it. And then do number 10. 


**10. CODE. **

Listen, as much as breaks and breathing and reading are important, the code isn't going to write itself. The best way to learn to code is to code. So, go back to the problem and attack. Try it from different angles, read how other people have accomplished what you're trying to do, obsess over Git repositories and Stack Overflow ideas. But, however you do it, go code. 




**Honorable mention: Get counseling.**

I love to throw this into most conversations. Counseling is amazing. If you're struggling with anger, sadness, focus, patience, or any of the million difficulties involved with being human... go to counseling. It's an incredible way to process the trauma and/or confusion of life. I think **literally** everyone should go to counseling for 6 months sometime in their life. 




# DON'Ts


And now, before this post ends, I want to give you some quick **DON'Ts**. These may not be don'ts for everyone. But they are suggestions that I'm working to get out of my rhythms. 


**1.)  Negative self-talk.**

The first thing I'm tempted to think when I can't solve a problem? "I'm not good at this." That's not true! I have a friend who taught me a lesson a few years ago. (Thanks Shannon!) She is a teacher in NYC and taught me that children often believe they 'aren't good at' Math or some other subject. She teaches them, using the growth mindset, that this is not true. 

"No. It's not that you aren't good at math. It's just that math is hard. Everyone struggles in some way with math. But if you apply yourself, keep practicing, and work hard, you can become at math over time."

This is the **key** to learning to program. 


**2.) Eat.**

Eating as a defense mechanism against anger or difficulty is never good. It becomes sort of automatic. It's easy to feel frustration and immediately run to the kitchen for comfort. I've done this way too often and it's a bad idea.  'Eating our feelings' is an easy way for programming to cause a lot of unhealth and pain in life. 



**3.) Social media. **

I love Twitter. Instagram is nice too. But jumping onto social media when you're mad at a coding problem will typically not solve the issue. Of course it can be helpful in doses, but I try to avoid using social media when I'm grumpy. Too much dopamine. 


**4.) Complaining.** 

This is a problem many of us must combat. Complaining solves nothing! Of course some talking it out can be very helpful. I love working problems out with friends or whiteboarding strategy. But 'I can't believe they gave me this assignment' or 'This language is ridiculous' over and over again really doesn't help.


**5.) Give up altogether. **

Don't give up. Do the ten things in the first half of this post... and get back in the ring. You got this. Problems can be solved. You are smarter than you think and, even if you don't know how to solve the problem, there are solutions and help available to everyone. If you have a problem you want help with and can't find good resources, reach out to me on Twitter and we'll make a party out of it. 



Okay, now you know how to deal with the anger you feel when you can't get the code to run properly. 

**Now get back to work.**
