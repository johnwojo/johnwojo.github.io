I recently set out to build my first big project! (Aside from the command line Star Wars game that I've been obsessing over..) It has been quite the experience. Since I enjoyed the process so thoroughly, I wanted to write down some thoughts about the project and provide a few of my takeaways at the same time.

First, I'll go over my process for creating the program. 

**1.) I started with an idea that I find personally exciting/interesting.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Stellar. Cryptocurrencies are all the rage right now. I've been watching charts for almost a year and I'm convinced that I've really just now begun to understand 1% of the entire ecosystem. It's fascinating! If you haven't entered the world of cryptocurrency, run (don't walk) to coinbase.com and set up your account. It's super interesting and I'm convinced that many of these assets will continue to rise in popularity and importance in the years to come. You don't need much to jump in - and now is the time! 

Why is this important? Because I wanted to program about something I care about! Coding is awesome, but it is most amazing because it can model so much of our world. So if you're tasked with creating something, why not create something you like? Of course you won't always love every project you need to work on, but you can find something fascinating, valuable, or enjoyable in it. If you think you can't, look harder! Use your imagination. How might the program you're creating today help someone else tomorrow? Whose life will be made better because of it? In what ways could it be faster? Prettier? Can you put an Easter egg in there for the next programmer whose going to need to look at this code? If you have to do something, you may as well LOVE it. 


**2.) Failure and frustration are important parts of the creative process. 

I successfully scraped a website - and created a command line interface through which you can create objects called Coins which model Cryptocurrencies. In my opinion, that's really incredible. Success! But nothing worth doing is easy. And this program was a total failure up until it was a major success. The default position was 'broken." And only after some intense scrutiny, googling, late night codathons, and a lot of brow-furrowing did it become something useful. It works now, but failure was a part of the process. 

This has been a big part of learning programming for me. I've had to set aside the desire to impress anyone, even myself. When I first started to code, I had no idea what I was doing. And I'm still a Padawan. Even though I can create a few fancy things and understand a lot more than I did, I have SO much to learn. And if I spend time worrying about failing or looking dumb or asking the wrong questions, I'll never create anything imaginative or innovative. A major example of frustration in creating this app was when I created the more_info functionality. At one point, the program asks whether you'd like more information about a specific coin. I needed it to take the user's answer, scrape back into the coin's profile page and insert that web page' s HTML into the coin objects I was trying to create. 

IT WOULD NOT WORK. For my life, I tried and tried and tried. I received the same error over and over again. I never knew I could be so frustrated. I asked google, classmates, tutors, multiple school-related & non-school-related slack channels, and looked at examples of other people's work. I spent no less than four hours one evening trying to write and rewrite a few lines of code. Eventually, I deleted the whole thing and started over. Instead of creating an entirely new scraper that removed information from a particular coin's profile page, I piggybacked the scraper off of one I had already created - and used the initial request to do more things. In the end, it worked. I was beyond elated. I looked up at my wife and almost screamed. IT WORKED. Finally. 


**3.) Done is better than perfect.

After submitting the assignment, I still have a number of updates I want to make to the program. What if instead of having to look the coin up by its number, what if you could look it up with a name? Or a price? How would I find a way to show all 1,513 cryptocurrencies instead of only the top 100 in circulation? Then... looking up infromation is nice, but what if it could remember the amounts of each coin that I actually hold? Or better yet, what if it could read from a spreadsheet and understand which coins I have, find their prices, calculate my current crypto-net-worth and save that information for me? Maybe it could save that information over time - and keep record of gains and losses over time. 

Okay, those are a few ideas that I would like to implement. But the point is that it doesn't need to be perfect immediately. Putting something out there is freeing. It is so much better than being stuck struggling with "paralysis by analysis."


**4.) Friends help.

The best thing I did in creating this program was involve others. I talked to my wife about it incessantly. I discussed it with my mom, brother, family, and friends. I found a partner through Slack who was working on a horoscope scraper and threw out question after question. I used slack channels (both through the school and outside the school). I contacted a staff mentor and got help when I felt stuck. The point is: You don't have to code alone. Why would you? Involving others helps them, helps you, and makes the finished product better. 

Every time I re-explained a problem or googled an idea, I got .008% better at describing what was happening, what needed to happen, and the gap between them. I became a better programmer as I asked questions, accepted help, and looked around for wisdom, encouragement, and pushback from others.




Overall, this project has been amazing for my growth as a developer. I certianly struggled here and there, but am proud of the result and can't wait to start my next adventure.
