In late 2018, I discovered a really interesting tool for web design that I would like to share. 

It's called Webflow.  [Here is the (very cool) website. ](https://webflow.com/)


If you have used tools like Canva  or Over, then Webflow will excite you. It essentially allows you to create entire sites, individual webpages, forms, animations, eCommerce options, and pretty much anything else you can imagine for the web. I have really enjoyed messing around with it. 

The exciting thing about Webflow is that you can not only host your own designs with them, but you can also download the code that makes up a project and export it to any other file. So... if you're not exactly sure how to build something the way you're imaginging, drag your code from Atom (or wherever you write code). It will render in Webflow and then you can move things around like you want them.


Webflow's website explains the product like this, "Build responsive websites in your browser, then host with us or export your code to host wherever. Discover the professional website builder made for designers."

I am begging to re-work my blog interface and am planning to imbed my YouTube, Github, Twitter, and Instagram content all into one place. Webflow is simplifying a lot of that, and I'm excited to roll things together now that the new year has begun. 


If you're interested in Webflow or the experiences I've had building fun client-focused products, reach out to me via email: jwojo13@gmail.com or on [twitter.](http://www.twitter.com/wojo_nyc)
