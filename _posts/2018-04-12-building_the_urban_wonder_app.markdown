For the last several months, I have poured myself into learning how to code. It has been an adventure. I have watched a million lectures, read chapters from a number of programming books, consumed article after article, and followed a large number of programmers on all the important social media channels. More than that, I have met amazing people and spent time building really interesting things. (And I've Googled - a lot.) 

We started by building small programs. Hello World. But, over time, my skills have grown - and I can now build things I really enjoy! For example, the Urban Wonder app is a Sinatra application. It includes elements of Ruby, HTML, some bootstrapped CSS, and uses the Rack web server interface. And it feels amazing to have built something that I would actually enjoy using.

Urban Wonder is designed to operate like a travel planner. A user can sign up, log in, create 'Cities' and then 'Experiences' which belong to those cities. The user has many cities and each city has many experiences. Behind the scenes, a number of forms are operating to make sure the user's data is persisted and stored properly. So let's say you're planning a trip to New York. If you're flying all the way out here, you would certainly want to see the Statue of Liberty. But there are also a million other things to do in the Big Apple. You might create ten or fifteen tasks to accomplish while in NY and then, as you complete each one, check them off your list. Once you've completed an experience, it shows up in your 'memories,' a sidebar of the app's interface. It's an enjoyable experience and creating it was fascinating - and challenging.

I was reminded of something very important during the production of this app. The default state of a program is broken. We learned at Flatiron that things always start off  by not working. If it worked perfectly, a solution (and a programmer) wouldn't be necesary! So we must welcome errors - they guide us to creating something worthwhile.

During this project, I kept hitting walls. I would have an issue with the relationship between two objects, and it seemed that no matter what I did, the problem persisted in one way or another. Each time, I would Google, ask questions, experiment with the code, and finally overcome the obstacle. However, once I solved that issue, another would appear. At times, it felt like trying to untangle Christmas Tree lights. Pulling on one cord only caused a bigger knot in another area! This was increasingly frustrating until I remembered what they taught us in class. Brokenness is the default. That's the point! We, as programmers, are working to solve problems - not just to sit around and enjoy properly working software. We are creating something - and art is often messy.

**Brokenness should be expected. It's an inescapable part of programming (and life!) And the sooner we remember to expect encounters with brokenness, the more prepared we can become to face problems with confidence and hope.**
