<p>Passionate about helping others. Interested in tangibly improving the world, technology, writing, and learning. I have experience coding in Ruby, HTML, CSS, SQLite, JavaScript, and React. I pivoted into tech after seven years in community development and Christian ministry. I love problem solving and am excited to join a development team that works together to overcome challenges and make the world better.</p>
